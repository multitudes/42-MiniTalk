# 42-MiniTalk (In progress)
The purpose of this project for 42Berlin is to code a small data exchange program using only the UNIX signals. (Version: 3)

## The rules
We have to turn in a Makefile.  
We have to handle errors thoroughly. In no way our program should quit unex-
pectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth).
Our program mustnâ€™t have memory leaks.  
We can have one global variable per program (one for the client and one for
the server), but we will have to justify their use.


### Allowed functions
In order to complete the mandatory part, we are allowed to use the following
functions:
â—¦ write  
â—¦ ft_printf and any equivalent we coded  
â—¦ signal  
â—¦ sigemptyset  
â—¦ sigaddset  
â—¦ sigaction  
â—¦ kill  
â—¦ getpid  
â—¦ malloc  
â—¦ free  
â—¦ pause  
â—¦ sleep  
â—¦ usleep  
â—¦ exit  

## Mandatory Part
We must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.  
The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.  
The client takes two parameters:  
â—¦ The server PID.  
â—¦ The string to send.  

The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
Once the string has been received, the server must print it.  
The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think
it takes too long, then it is probably too long.

Our server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without
needing to restart. The communication between the client and the server has to be done only using
UNIX signals.  We can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.  

## Bonus part
The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the
client. Unicode characters support!

## Signals and IPC
In Linux, signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred. Processes can send signals to other processes, and a process can define how it responds to different signals. Two common signals used for communication between processes are `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`, which stand for "User-defined signal 1" and "User-defined signal 2," respectively.

## A first draft
Here's a basic example of two programs communicating with each other using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.  

Each signal is defined as a unique (small) integer, starting sequentially from 1. These integers are defined in <signal.h> with symbolic names of the form SIGxxxx.

When the process receives a signal, he can either ignore it, terminate or block it and react later. Also upon receiving a signal we could launch a handler to do some cleaning before quitting for example. When we change the default behaviour for a signal, this is also called changing the disposition of a signal. There are a few ways to do that.  There are a few ways of changing the disposition of a signal.  

The first, signal(), is prototyped like this, with the handler which is a pointer to a function:   
```c
#include <signal.h>
void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int)))(int);
```
or with a typedef making it easier to read:
```c
typedef void (*sig_t) (int);

sig_t
signal(int sig, sig_t func);
```
The second argument is the handler to be called when the signal arrives:
```c
void    handler(int sig)
{
    /* Code for the handler */
}
```
From the man pages:  
>  This signal() facility is a simplified interface to the more general sigaction(2) facility.

Example of soft exit sending a ^C (interrupt signal or SIGINT) to a process.  
```c
/* change the disposition with signal() and add the handler, check that it has not failed */
if (signal(SIGINT, exit_handler) == SIG_ERR)
    return (exit_err("signal failed\n"));
```
The handler
```c
void	exit_handler(int sig)
{
	(void)sig;
	write(1,"\n== bye bye! ==\n",9);
	exit(0);
}
```


### Program 1 - the receiver

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void signal_handler(int signo) {
    if (signo == SIGUSR1) {
        printf("Received SIGUSR1 signal.\n");
    } else if (signo == SIGUSR2) {
        printf("Received SIGUSR2 signal.\n");
    }
}

void	exit_handler(int sig)
{
	(void)sig;
	write(1,"\n== bye bye! ==\n",9);
	exit(0);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGUSR1, signal_handler); /* add checks */
    signal(SIGUSR2, signal_handler); /* add checks */
    
    /* with checks */
    if (signal(SIGINT, exit_handler) == SIG_ERR)
		return (exit_err("signal failed\n"));


    // Infinite loop to keep the program running
    while (1) {
        sleep(); // sleep will save CPU cycles since the process is blocked here until a signal is received
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Launching it will give :

```
$> ./server
server pid 22473 
^C
== bye bye ==
$>     
```

### Program 2 - the sender

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void signal_handler(int signo) {
    if (signo == SIGUSR1) {
        printf("Sender process received SIGUSR1 signal.\n");
    } else if (signo == SIGUSR2) {
        printf("Sender process received SIGUSR2 signal.\n");
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Get the process ID of the target process and pass it as arg with the message
	if (!(argc == 3) || !_getint(argv[1]) || argv[1] == NULL)
		return (exit_err("Usage ./client pid message\n"));
    target_pid = _getint(argv[1]); /* _getint is an utility func */

    // register the signal handlers. In this case It is the same for both
    if (signal(SIGUSR1, signal_handler) == SIG_ERR)
        /* exit code here */;
    if (signal(SIGUSR2, signal_handler) == SIG_ERR)
        ;  /* exit code here */;

    // Infinite loop to keep the program running
    while (1) {
        // Send SIGUSR1 signal to the target process
        kill(target_pid, SIGUSR1);
        sleep(2);

        // Send SIGUSR2 signal to the target process
        kill(target_pid, SIGUSR2);
        sleep(2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can obtain the PID of Program 1 by running it and checking the process ID using tools like `ps` or `pgrep`.  
In this example, the program 1 registers signal handlers for `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. The program 2 sends these signals to the other process using the `kill` system call. The Sender process, upon receiving the signals, executes the corresponding signal handler functions.

There are also more advanced IPC mechanisms available for inter-process communication, such as pipes, sockets, and message queues but in this project the challenge is to use only the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

## SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are available for programmer-defined purposes. The kernel never generates these signals for a process. Processes may use these signals to notify one another of events or to synchronize with each other. In early UNIX implementations, these were the only two signals that could be freely used in applications. (In fact, processes can send one another any signal, but this has the potential for confusion if the kernel also generates one of the signals for a process.) Modern UNIX implemen- tations provide a large set of realtime signals that are also available for programmer-defined purposes 

# Unicode
Definitely one of the most interesting aspects of this project has been delving deeper into Unicode. What an increadible and underrated standard for displaying characters in multiple scripts and idioms including emoji and majong tiles!
I realized that I did not need to add any special support. Sending an emoji is interpreted and decoded automatically in the shell terminal. 
## The way it is built
Unicode has a few variants. UTF-8 is a multibytes encoding. 
For example since it is still compatible with ascii, which in its basic form needs 7 bits. (See the man ascii mage for the values from 0 to 127.) When encoding a a char it will be using 1 byte. But when using the ðŸ¥° emoji it will use 4 bytes (32 bits). How does this work? Lets examine the 4 bytes in the emoji encoding as I send them to the serveer:  
11110000 10011111 10100101 10110000 00000000  
The last byte is all zeroes. This is my end of string '\0' null terminator.  
I have 4 bytes.  
11110000 10011111 10100101 10110000  




Let's evaluate the binary sequence `11110000100111111010010110110000`:

- First byte: `11110000` (4 bits of data)
- Second byte: `10011111` (6 bits of data)
- Third byte: `10100101` (6 bits of data)
- Fourth byte: `10110000` (5 bits of data)

Concatenating all the bits together:

```
11110000 10011111 10100101 10110000
   11110000100111111010010110110000
```

Now, the correct binary `11110000100111111010010110110000` corresponds to the Unicode code point represented by this UTF-8 sequence.

In decimal, this code point is `128368`, which is the correct Unicode code point for the "ðŸ¥°" emoji (SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES AND THREE HEARTS). I apologize for the earlier oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention.


## Unicode Code points
In Unicode, characters can be represented using their hexadecimal code points. The code point for the "ðŸ¥°" emoji is U+1F970. When you enter <0001f970> in some contexts, the system might interpret it as a Unicode escape sequence or code point, leading to the display of the corresponding emoji.

### The header signal.h on mac?
I was looking for the signal.h header file on my mac. There is the command locate for that. Turns out that there are many versions of this file on my system depending of where it is used!
```
locate signal.h
```





Yes, in a UTF-8 encoded Unicode sequence, the first few bits of the first byte indicate the total number of bytes used to represent the character. UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding, meaning that different characters may use different numbers of bytes. The leading bits of the first byte help determine the length of the encoded sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the structure of a UTF-8 encoded sequence:

- If the first byte starts with `0`, it represents a single-byte character (ASCII character) and is followed by 7 bits of character data.
- If the first byte starts with `110`, it represents a two-byte character and is followed by a total of 11 bits of character data spread across the first and second bytes.
- If the first byte starts with `1110`, it represents a three-byte character and is followed by a total of 16 bits of character data spread across the first, second, and third bytes.
- If the first byte starts with `11110`, it represents a four-byte character and is followed by a total of 21 bits of character data spread across the first, second, third, and fourth bytes.

The remaining bytes in a multi-byte sequence start with `10` followed by 6 bits of character data.
